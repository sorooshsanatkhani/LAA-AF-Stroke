# nonNewtonianDistVel
nonNewtonianDistVel solver is developed to simulate non-Newtonian blood flow based on Quemada model inside LA/LAA until reaching steady state. The velocity and pressure fields computed in steady state is then used as initial values for simulating tracer concentration transport using passiveScalarAdvection solver. The simulation setup for nonNewtonianDistVel solver is similar to ScalarAdvection solver. However, transport equation is not solved in this solver. Therefore, all associated parts to transport equation are omitted. Instead, the hematocrit levels, plasma viscosity, and maximum allows viscosity for blood need to be set in transportProperties file. nonNewtonianDistVel solver is consisted of createFields.H, createVelocityInlet.H, DistributedVelocityInlet.C, DistributedVelocityInletFvPatchVectorField.C, DistributedVelocityInletFvPatchVectorField.H, nonNewtonianDistVel.C, Quemada.C, and Quemada.H.
