icoFoamDistVel solver is based on original icoFoam where DistributedVelocityInlet boundary condition is included to distribute blood flow between PV inlets. This solver is consisted of createFields.H, createVelocityInlet.H, DistributedVelocityInlet.C, DistributedVelocityInletFvPatchVectorField.C, DistributedVelocityInletFvPatchVectorField.H, and icoFoamDistVel.C
