# Hemodynamic Indices and Shape-Based Models of Left Atrial Appendage to Enhance Stroke Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation
## Abstract
Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent arrhythmia, that causes thrombus formation, ordinarily in the left atrial appendage (LAA). The conventional metric of stroke risk stratification, CHA2DS2-VASc score, does not account for LAA morphology or hemodynamics. We showed in our previous study that residence time distribution (RTD) of blood-borne particles in the LAA and its associated calculated variables (i.e., mean residence time, tm, and asymptotic concentration, C∞) have the potential to improve CHA2DS2-VASc score. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of the following potential confounding factors on LAA tm and C∞: (1) pulmonary vein flow waveform pulsatility, (2) non-Newtonian blood rheology and hematocrit level, and (3) length of the simulation.
Methods: Subject-Specific data including left atrial (LA) and LAA cardiac computed tomography, cardiac output (CO), heart rate, and hematocrit level were gathered from 25 AF subjects. We calculate LAA tm and C∞ based on series of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses.
Results: Both LAA tm and C∞ are significantly affected by the CO, but not by temporal pattern of the inlet flow. Both LAA tm and C∞ increase with increasing hematocrit level and both calculated indices are higher for non-Newtonian blood rheology for a given hematocrit level. Further, at least 20,000 s of CFD simulation is needed to calculate LAA tm and C∞ values reliably.
Conclusions: Subject-specific LA and LAA geometries, CO, and hematocrit level are essential to quantify the subject-specific proclivity of blood cell tarrying inside LAA in terms of the RTD function.
## OpenFOAM Solvers
Several OpenFOAM solvers and boundary conditions were developed for this dissertation based on original OpenFOAM codes. To investigate the effects of patient-specific PV flow waveform, we developed the **ScalarAdvection** solver which is based on original icoFoam solver of OpenFOAM. In this solver transport equation is coupled with the momentum equations. To investigate the effects of patient-specific hematocrit levels and non-Newtonian vs. Newtonian fluid modeling, we developed **nonNewtonianDistVel**, **icoFoamDistVel**, and **passiveScalarAdvection** solvers which are based on original nonNewtonianIcoFoam, icoFoam, and ScalarTransportFoam solvers of OpenFOAM, respectively. In our final simulations, nonNewtonianDistVel and passiveScalarAdvection solvers were used.
